## Flutter Community Challenges

Flutter Commity Challenges is an app that will serve as a client tool for Flutter-centric
challenges.

The whole Flutter community is invited to submit ideas for
future challenges, to take part by submitting their own apps or
even just vote to their favourite app or upcoming challenge.

Users will have 14 days to submit their entry. Once the submission time ends users will have 48 hours to review and vote on the submissions.

At the end of each challenge the most voted apps will be recorded in
the Hall of Fame and the most voted challenge will be selected as the
next one.
