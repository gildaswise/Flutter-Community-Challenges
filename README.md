# Flutter Community Challenges

It's an app that will serve as a client tool for Flutter-centric
challenges.
The whole Flutter community is invited to submit ideas for
future challenges, to take part by submitting their own apps or
even just vote to their favourite app or upcoming challenge.
Once the submission time ends the review and voting period starts and
lasts something around a couple of days.
At the end of each challenge the most voted apps will be glorified in
the Hall of Fame and the most voted challenge will be selected as the
next one.
